- Title: Software developer
- Headline: A coder with experience in finance, a former chemist
- Professional pitch: I am a software developer with experience in finance, business, and scientific research. I was trained as a chemist and worked as a financial analyst, during my educational and professional career, I came across numerous problems that were very monotonous to solve by hand, so I started to code to not only to automate the boring work, but also aid me to solve the complex problems. I am excited to use my analytical and quantitative reasoning skills in my future career, and I look forward to going further in the finacial technology sector.
- Why coding excites you: With the advancement of technology, many problems became increasingly defficult to solve by hand. I am excited to be able to automate the boring work and use the power of programming to solve more complex problems, and to start a journey as a financial analyst who codes.
